Key notes / additions:

Cookies: Sent automatically with every HTTP request to the server, which can affect performance. Often used for authentication tokens.
Local Storage: Data persists even after closing the browser, not sent with requests, and usually used for larger client-side storage (e.g., user preferences).
Session Storage: Data only exists for the lifetime of the tab. Great for temporary states like form data before submission.


Cookies (Client-Side)
Small text files stored in the browser by a website.
Can persist even after closing the tab or browser (until expiry date or manually deleted).
Accessible by both browser (JavaScript) and server (sent automatically with every HTTP request).
Common uses:
‚ÄúRemember me‚Äù login
Tracking user behavior (analytics/ads)


üîπ Session Storage (Client-Side)
Part of Web Storage API in the browser (HTML5 feature).
Data is stored only in the browser tab.
Gets cleared when the tab or window is closed.
Example: You type something in a form, navigate around in the same tab, and the data stays. But if you open a new tab ‚Üí data is gone.
Stored on client-side only (server doesn‚Äôt see it unless you send it manually via JS).

üîπ Session (Server-Side)
Managed by the backend (server), not the browser.
Typically uses a Session ID stored in a cookie to identify the user.
Data (like login state, shopping cart, user preferences) is stored on the server.
Session ends when:
The user logs out,
The session times out (e.g., 30 min of inactivity), or
The server is restarted (unless persisted).


| Feature                   | **Session Storage (Client-Side)**                      | **Session (Server-Side)**                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Where stored?**         | In the **browser‚Äôs memory**, only for the current tab  | On the **server** (database, memory, or file system)                      |
| **Lifetime**              | Until the **tab/window is closed**                     | Until user logs out or session times out (e.g., 30 min inactivity)        |
| **Scope**                 | **Per tab** (different tabs don‚Äôt share it)            | **Shared across all tabs** (as long as the session ID cookie is valid)    |
| **Accessible by**         | JavaScript on the client                               | Server-side code (PHP, Node.js, Django, etc.)                             |
| **Data Size Limit**       | ~5MB (depends on browser)                              | Depends on server resources (usually much larger)                         |
| **Security**              | Can be read by client-side JS (less secure if misused) | Safer ‚Äî stored on server, user only has session ID                        |
| **Use Cases**             | Temporary form data, state per tab, UI preferences     | Login/authentication, shopping carts, user profiles, payment sessions     |
| **Connection to Cookies** | Independent (not sent with requests)                   | Usually **identified via a cookie** (`session_id`) sent with each request |



‚úÖ Simple difference:
Session Storage = Browser memory (client-side, per tab).
Session = Server memory (server-side, shared across tabs for the same user if cookie/session ID matches).

Example with login:

If you log in on a site:
Session (server) stores your user ID on the backend.
Cookie holds your session ID so the server knows "it‚Äôs you."
If devs wanted, they might use Session Storage to hold something temporary like a form draft, not your actual login.



Cookies
Size Limit: ~4KB per cookie (small storage).
Lifetime: Can have an expiry date; otherwise expires when the browser closes (session cookie).
Where Stored: Saved in the browser but sent to the server with every HTTP request (in request headers).
Use Case: Best for server-related info like authentication/session tokens, remembering logged-in users, tracking.
Accessible By: JavaScript (document.cookie) and server.
Performance: Slower (extra data sent to server every request).

Local Storage
Size Limit: ~5‚Äì10 MB (much larger than cookies).
Lifetime: Data persists until manually cleared by user or code (doesn‚Äôt expire automatically).
Where Stored: Only in the browser (client-side), not sent to server automatically.
Use Case: Storing large amounts of client-only data like preferences, themes, cart items, form drafts.
Accessible By: JavaScript (localStorage).
Performance: Faster (no server round trip).


Cookies ‚Üí small, server + client, expire.
Local Storage ‚Üí bigger, only client-side, persistent.




1. What‚Äôs happening when you see retargeted ads?
Suppose you searched for shoes on Myntra and later see ads for the same shoes on Facebook.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on step by step:
1) Myntra sets a cookie on your browser
When you visit Myntra, their site (or an ad network embedded on their site) stores a tracking cookie in your browser.
This cookie might include a unique ID like user_12345 ‚Äî it does not usually contain your personal name or password, just a unique identifier.

2)You leave Myntra and browse other sites
Many websites, including Facebook, have ad networks like Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc., embedded.
These ad networks can read the tracking cookie (or see the unique ID if they set their own cookie via Myntra).

3)Ad networks match the cookie ID
The ad network knows: ‚ÄúUser with ID 12345 visited Myntra and looked at shoes.‚Äù
So when you browse Facebook, the network serves shoe ads tailored to you.

2. Are your cookies shared?

Not exactly ‚Äúsharing your cookies‚Äù
Cookies are per domain, meaning Myntra‚Äôs cookies cannot be directly read by Facebook.
But advertising/tracking networks can set cookies across multiple websites (called third-party cookies).
Example: doubleclick.net or facebook.com pixels on Myntra.
These cookies track you across sites without giving Facebook direct access to Myntra‚Äôs cookies.

What they know
They know your browser/device ID, visited pages, products viewed.
Usually no personal info like passwords unless you typed it somewhere.

3. How this is used for retargeting
You visited Myntra ‚Üí tracking cookie recorded ‚Üí ad network remembered ‚Äúshoe interest‚Äù ‚Üí later, Facebook shows shoe ads.
This is why ads ‚Äúfollow you around‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs based on browser/device tracking, not direct cookie sharing.

‚úÖ Summary

Cookies are not ‚Äúshared‚Äù between sites, but third-party cookies let ad networks track users across multiple sites.
They identify your browser and interests, not your personal info.
Retargeting ads = matching your browsing behaviour to ads using these tracking cookies.




1. Who pays whom?
Myntra (advertiser) wants you to see their shoes even after you leave the site.
They pay ad networks (like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or other ad companies) to show ads to users who visited Myntra.
These ad networks use third-party cookies or pixels to track user behavior across other websites.





why third-party cookies are disappearing and what‚Äôs replacing them.
1. The problem with third-party cookies
Privacy concerns: Cookies allowed ad networks to track users across multiple websites without explicit consent.
Browser restrictions:
Safari (Apple) and Firefox block third-party cookies by default.
Chrome (Google) is planning to phase them out completely.
Regulations: Laws like GDPR (Europe) and CCPA (California) require websites to get consent before tracking users.


2. What‚Äôs replacing third-party cookies?
a) First-party data
Websites collect their own data directly (like Myntra tracking you on their site only).
No third-party cookie needed.
Example: Myntra remembers your search history only when you are on Myntra.

1. First-party ads on Myntra

When you browse Myntra, everything happens on Myntra‚Äôs own website.
Myntra already knows what you‚Äôre doing:
Products you clicked
Products you searched for
Items in your cart
This is first-party data ‚Äî no third-party cookies are needed because Myntra owns the website.

2. How they decide which ads to show

You search for ‚Äúrunning shoes.‚Äù
Myntra stores this info in first-party storage (like their own server session or local storage).
Myntra‚Äôs website dynamically changes the banners and recommendations to show:
‚ÄúPeople who viewed running shoes also bought‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúRecommended for you‚Äù
All of this happens inside Myntra, using your actions on their site.

On Myntra (first-party ads):
Uses Myntra‚Äôs own data, no need to track you elsewhere.
Fully under their control.
On other sites like Facebook (retargeting):
Requires third-party cookies or ad networks to show you the same Myntra shoes elsewhere.


‚úÖ In short:
On Myntra: They use first-party tracking ‚Üí they know your browsing behavior on their site ‚Üí can show relevant products/ads immediately.
Off Myntra (cross-site): They need ad networks + cookies to follow you around.




b) Privacy Sandbox / FLoC / Topics API (Google)
Google‚Äôs new approach groups users with similar interests instead of tracking individuals.
Your browser shares only ‚Äúinterest topics,‚Äù not personal history.
Advertisers get targeting, but your identity is private.

. Google Privacy Sandbox / Topics API

Where it works: Across the web (outside Myntra).
How it works:
Your browser locally groups your interests into ‚Äútopics‚Äù (e.g., Sports Shoes, Fitness).
Only these interest topics are shared with websites that serve ads.
Advertisers see: ‚ÄúThis user is interested in Sports Shoes‚Äù ‚Äî but don‚Äôt see your identity, name, or exact browsing history
Data shared: Only broad interest categories ‚Üí your personal actions on Myntra remain private.



‚úÖ In short:
Myntra‚Äôs method = exact personalised ads on their own site.
Privacy Sandbox = broad, anonymous interest-based ads across sites, privacy-friendly.



This site uses cookies. Accept/Reject‚Äù banners you see everywhere ‚Äî what‚Äôs really going on inside. Let‚Äôs break it down carefully, step by step.

1. Why websites show cookie consent banners
1)Privacy laws require it
GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California), and similar laws around the world require websites to:
Inform users that cookies are being used
Ask for permission for certain types of cookies (especially third-party tracking cookies)
Without consent, websites could face legal penalties.

2)Types of cookies
Websites often use multiple types of cookies:
| Type                                  | Purpose                                                          | Consent Needed? |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Necessary cookies**                 | Required for the site to function (login, cart, page navigation) | Usually NO      |
| **Preferences / Functional cookies**  | Remember language, theme, etc.                                   | Sometimes YES   |
| **Analytics / Performance cookies**   | Track user behavior on the site                                  | YES             |
| **Advertising / Third-party cookies** | Retargeting, ad networks                                         | YES             |



2. What happens when you see the banner
1)Website loads your page
It may load minimal ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù cookies immediately.
Scripts for tracking or ads are paused until you accept.

2)You click ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù
Website runs scripts that:
Set cookies in your browser (first-party or third-party)
Allow ad networks or analytics tools to track you
Example: Google Analytics can now start recording your page views.

3)You click ‚ÄúReject‚Äù
Website only sets necessary cookies.
Tracking/ads cookies are blocked or not initialized.

4)Your choice is stored
Usually in a first-party cookie called something like cookie_consent=true/false.
Next time you visit, the site knows your choice and won‚Äôt show the banner again.


4. Key points

Necessary cookies don‚Äôt require consent
E.g., login sessions, shopping cart.
Consent only applies to optional cookies
Analytics, marketing, advertising, personalization beyond essential functionality.
The website usually stores your choice in a cookie
So you don‚Äôt get asked every time you visit.
You can change your choice anytime
Most websites provide a ‚ÄúPrivacy Settings‚Äù or ‚ÄúCookie Settings‚Äù option.

In short:
Banner = legal + technical control to respect your privacy.
Accept ‚Üí optional cookies and tracking start.
Reject ‚Üí only essential cookies are active.
Everything is controlled via scripts and cookies in your browser.




1. What is Local Storage?
Local Storage is part of the Web Storage API in browsers.
It stores data only on your browser, not sent to the server automatically.
Unlike cookies:
Much bigger size (~5‚Äì10 MB per site)
Persistent until cleared manually (doesn‚Äôt expire like session cookies)
Only accessible via JavaScript


2. Why websites use localStorage
| Use Case               | Example                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preferences / Settings | Dark mode, language choice                               |
| Shopping cart          | Items you added but not logged in                        |
| Form data              | Autosave form drafts so you don‚Äôt lose them              |
| Temporary data caching | Reduce server requests by storing small datasets locally |
| Game state / apps      | Progress saved for offline usage                         |


3. What happens when a site uses localStorage
Website runs a JavaScript script
Example: localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark') ‚Üí stores your theme choice.
No banner is legally required because localStorage doesn‚Äôt automatically track you across sites (not considered tracking by GDPR/CCPA unless used with other tracking mechanisms).
Storing data
Data is saved in your browser under the website‚Äôs domain.
Only that website can read/write it (document.domain).
Retrieving data
Example: On next visit, site can run:
Your choice persists until you clear it (or the site clears it with localStorage.removeItem()).
No automatic server sharing
Unlike cookies, localStorage does not go to the server on each request.
The server only sees it if the website‚Äôs JavaScript explicitly sends it via fetch or XHR.


4. Inside the browser
The browser keeps a key-value store for each website.
Your data is isolated per domain (site A cannot read site B‚Äôs localStorage).
Scripts control:
What is stored
When it‚Äôs updated
When it‚Äôs deleted

| Feature        | Cookies                          | Local Storage                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server sharing | Sent automatically with requests | Not sent automatically                                            |
| Size           | ~4 KB                            | ~5‚Äì10 MB                                                          |
| Consent        | Optional cookies require consent | Usually no consent needed (unless used for tracking across sites) |
| Lifetime       | Can expire                       | Persistent until cleared manually                                 |
| Access         | Server + JS                      | Only JS (client-side)                                             |


‚úÖ In short:
LocalStorage is like a private notebook for each website, where the site can write and read data locally.
Unlike cookies, it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútravel‚Äù with requests or require legal consent unless combined with tracking.
Perfect for preferences, carts, drafts, or temporary caching.

Explanation
localStorage is per-domain: Only this website‚Äôs scripts can access it.
Persistent: Data stays until cleared, unlike sessionStorage which clears on tab close.
Not sent to server automatically: Must be sent manually if needed (e.g., via fetch).

cookies and sessions are related but not the same, and they often work together in web applications.
1. Session Basics
A session is server-side storage for a user‚Äôs data.
Example: User logs in ‚Üí server remembers ‚Äúuser ID = 123‚Äù for that session.
Sessions are temporary: usually expire after inactivity or when the browser closes.
The server needs a way to know which session belongs to which user.

2. Cookies Basics
A cookie is client-side storage in the browser.
Can store small pieces of data: session ID, preferences, etc.
Cookies are sent with every HTTP request to the server (for the domain that set them).

3. How Cookies & Sessions Work Together
User logs in on a website.
Server creates a session ‚Üí assigns a unique session ID (like ABC123).
Server sends a cookie to your browser:
Set-Cookie: sessionId=ABC123; Path=/; HttpOnly
Browser stores the cookie and sends it with every request:
Cookie: sessionId=ABC123
Server reads the cookie ‚Üí identifies the session ‚Üí retrieves session data (e.g., user ID, cart items).
Result: You stay logged in while navigating different pages.

‚úÖ In short:

Sessions store data on the server.
Cookies store the session ID on the client.
They work together: cookies tell the server ‚Äúhey, this is your session,‚Äù server retrieves session data.
Without cookies, sessions need extra work (like passing the session ID in URLs).

Explanation in Myntra context
Session = server-side data about you (user ID, cart, login).
Cookie = small piece of data in your browser (session ID) that lets Myntra know which session belongs to you.
Flow: Cookie tells the server ‚Äúthis is you‚Äù ‚Üí server retrieves session ‚Üí you see your cart and stay logged in.

üí° Key point:
Without cookies, Myntra would have to pass the session ID in the URL every time (messy and less secure).
Cookies + sessions = smooth, secure, and persistent login experience.




üîπ Imagine this flow on Myntra
Step 1: You open Myntra and log in
You enter your email + password.
Myntra‚Äôs server checks your credentials and says ‚úÖ ‚ÄúOkay, this is Sarthak.‚Äù

Step 2: Server creates a session
On the server, Myntra creates a session object in memory or database.
Example session data stored on Myntra‚Äôs server:
sessionId = ABC123
userId = 98765
name = "Sarthak"
cart = ["Shoes", "T-shirt"]
loginStatus = true
This data stays on Myntra‚Äôs server, not in your browser.

Step 3: Server gives your browser a cookie
Myntra sends back an HTTP response with a Set-Cookie header:
Set-Cookie: sessionId=ABC123; HttpOnly; Secure
Your browser saves this cookie.
The cookie contains only the sessionId, not your cart or personal details.

Step 4: You visit another page on Myntra (e.g., Men‚Äôs Shoes)
Your browser automatically sends the cookie back with the request:
Cookie: sessionId=ABC123
Now Myntra‚Äôs server sees the cookie, looks up sessionId=ABC123 in its database/memory, and finds your session:
userId = 98765
cart = ["Shoes", "T-shirt"]
loginStatus = true

Step 5: Server shows personalized content
Since Myntra knows it‚Äôs you, it:
Keeps you logged in (no need to enter password again).
Shows your shopping cart items.
Recommends products based on your past searches.

Step 6: Session expires or you log out
If you log out, Myntra deletes the session from the server.
Your cookie (sessionId=ABC123) is also cleared/invalid.
Next time you open Myntra, there‚Äôs no valid session ‚Üí you must log in again.


üîë Key Idea

Session = data stored on Myntra‚Äôs server (cart, login status, etc.).
Cookie = tiny ticket stored in your browser that says ‚ÄúWhich session is mine?‚Äù.
Browser sends this ticket (cookie) to Myntra with every request ‚Üí Myntra looks up your session data ‚Üí you stay logged in & cart is preserved.

‚úÖ In short for Myntra:
Session holds your actual data securely on the server.
Cookie only holds a session ID (like a claim ticket).
Both work together so Myntra knows it‚Äôs still you across pages.



stateless JWT tokens step by step. I‚Äôll compare it with sessions + cookies (like we did with Myntra) so you can clearly see what‚Äôs happening inside.
üîπ 1. Problem with Sessions (Stateful Authentication)
With sessions, server stores session data (cart, user info, login status).
Server must remember each user‚Äôs session in memory/database.
If Myntra has millions of users, managing sessions takes lots of resources.
Also, in distributed systems (multiple servers), session sharing is hard.
üëâ That‚Äôs where JWT (JSON Web Token) comes in.

üîπ 2. What is JWT?
JWT = JSON Web Token.
It‚Äôs a stateless way of authentication.
All user info is stored inside the token itself, not on the server.
Format:xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
Header (metadata: type & algorithm)
Payload (user info, claims)
Signature (to verify authenticity)

3. Example Flow (Stateless Login with JWT)
Step 1: User Logs In
You log in with email + password on Myntra.
POST /login
{
  "email": "sarthak@example.com",
  "password": "123456"
}

Step 2: Server generates JWT
If credentials are correct, server generates a JWT:
Header (algorithm + type):
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
Payload (your info):
{
  "userId": 98765,
  "name": "Sarthak",
  "role": "customer",
  "exp": 1735831200   // expiry time (UNIX timestamp)
}
Signature:
Server signs header + payload with a secret key.
This prevents tampering.

Step 3: Server sends JWT to client
Instead of creating a session, server just gives JWT to browser.
Browser stores it in localStorage or cookie.


Step 4: Client makes next request
When you visit /cart:
GET /cart
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

Step 5: Server verifies JWT

Server checks:
Is the signature valid?
Is token expired?
If valid ‚Üí reads payload directly (userId, role, etc.).
No need to look up a session in DB ‚Üí server is stateless.

Step 6: Response
Server knows it‚Äôs you from the JWT payload.
Returns cart items.

üîπ 4. Key Difference: Session vs JWT
| Feature        | Sessions (Stateful)          | JWT (Stateless)                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Data storage   | Server stores session data   | All data in token (client-side)  |
| Identification | Cookie with sessionId        | Token in header (Authorization)  |
| Server load    | Server must manage sessions  | Server only verifies token       |
| Scalability    | Hard across multiple servers | Easy (token works on any server) |
| Expiry         | Session timeout              | Exp claim in token               |



üîπ 5. Inside JWT (What‚Äôs Happening)
User info is inside the token (payload).
Server doesn‚Äôt store anything ‚Üí only uses secret key to verify token.
Every request is self-contained:
Token proves who you are.
No need for session lookup.

‚úÖ In short:
With sessions, server ‚Äúremembers‚Äù you.
With JWT, you carry your identity (signed token) and prove it every time.

‚úÖ Summary in plain words:
JWT is created once at login (contains user info).
Client stores it and sends it with each request.
Server only verifies it, no database session lookup needed.
Completely stateless ‚Üí any server can verify the same token.

1. What is localStorage really?
localStorage is not shared globally across all users.
It‚Äôs per browser + per domain (website).
That means:
If you and I both log into Myntra on our own laptops, each of us has a separate browser localStorage.
My browser cannot see your tokens, and yours cannot see mine.



üîπ 4. Important: LocalStorage vs Cookies for JWT
If JWT is stored in localStorage ‚Üí it stays until you manually clear it or logout.
If JWT is stored in cookies ‚Üí it can be sent automatically with requests, but has CSRF risks.
That‚Äôs why some apps store JWT in HttpOnly cookies (more secure) instead of localStorage.



‚úÖ Answer to your doubt:
Myntra does not have one single shared localStorage for all users.
Each person has their own isolated localStorage inside their own browser.
So JWT tokens are stored per-user, per-browser, per-website.

JWT tokens can be less secure depending on where and how you store them. Let‚Äôs go deep into this:
üîπ Why JWT can be less secure than sessions?
1. Where it‚Äôs stored
If stored in localStorage:
‚úÖ Easy to use.
‚ùå Vulnerable to XSS attacks (if malicious JS runs on page, it can read your token and steal it).
If stored in cookies
‚úÖ Can be safer if marked HttpOnly (JavaScript can‚Äôt read it).
‚ùå Vulnerable to CSRF attacks (attackers trick your browser into sending cookie).


2. Long-lived tokens
JWTs often contain expiry times like 1h, 7d, 30d.
If stolen, attacker can use it until expiry.
With sessions, server can kill session immediately.
With JWT, server can‚Äôt revoke easily unless you add a ‚Äúblacklist‚Äù system.


3. JWT stores data on client
Payload contains user info (userId, role, etc.).
Even though it‚Äôs signed (can‚Äôt be tampered without key), anyone can decode it (base64).
So never store sensitive stuff like passwords inside JWT.


üîπ Security Best Practices with JWT

Store JWT in HttpOnly Secure Cookie (better than localStorage).
Use short expiration times (like 15 minutes for access token).
Refresh tokens:
Use a second long-lived token (refresh token) stored securely.
Get new access tokens when old ones expire.
Always use HTTPS (so tokens can‚Äôt be sniffed).
Validate signature + expiry on server every time.
Optionally maintain a token blacklist (so you can revoke stolen tokens).

| Method                               | Security Risk                                   | Use Case                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| JWT in **localStorage**              | XSS (can be stolen by injected JS)              | Simple apps, prototypes  |
| JWT in **cookie (HttpOnly, Secure)** | CSRF (fixable with SameSite flags, CSRF tokens) | Production apps          |
| Sessions + Cookies                   | Server load (must store sessions)               | Very secure, traditional |

So you are correct: JWT can be less secure if stored in localStorage.
üëâ That‚Äôs why big companies (like Myntra, Amazon, etc.) often use JWT in secure cookies instead.

üîπ Security Comparison
1. Sessions + Cookies (Stateful)
‚úÖ Very secure:
Session data lives only on server.
Browser stores only a sessionId (useless without server data).
If stolen, server can kill session instantly.
‚ùå Needs server memory/DB to store sessions.
‚ùå Harder to scale (multiple servers must share session DB).
üëâ Best for traditional secure logins (banking apps, e-commerce like Myntra, etc.).


2. JWT in LocalStorage (Stateless)
‚ùå Less secure:
Vulnerable to XSS attacks (malicious JS can steal token).
If stolen, attacker can use it until expiry (no server kill-switch).
‚úÖ Scales easily (no server session storage).
‚úÖ Simple for APIs and microservices.
üëâ Only okay for small apps or if XSS is fully controlled (which is rare).


3. JWT in HttpOnly Secure Cookie (Stateless Hybrid)
‚úÖ More secure than localStorage:
Cookie can‚Äôt be read by JS (HttpOnly).
Works only over HTTPS (Secure).
CSRF risk, but mitigated using SameSite=Strict or CSRF tokens.
‚úÖ Scales easily like JWT.
‚ùå Still harder to revoke tokens quickly (server doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúremember‚Äù them unless you add a blacklist).
üëâ Good for large distributed apps (Google, Facebook, Myntra-like scale).

Final Verdict (Security First)
Maximum Security ‚Üí ‚úÖ Sessions + Cookies
Server controls everything.
If stolen, session can be killed.
Best when security is more important than scalability (banking, healthcare).
Balanced Security + Scalability ‚Üí ‚úÖ JWT in HttpOnly Secure Cookie
Works well for modern apps.
Protects against XSS (token not accessible by JS).
Needs extra CSRF protection.
Best for large-scale apps (Myntra, Amazon, Flipkart).
Lowest Security ‚Üí ‚ùå JWT in LocalStorage
Should only be used for learning/prototypes.
Too risky for real production apps.

‚úÖ Best Choice for Security: Sessions + Cookies
‚úÖ Best Choice for Modern Large Systems: JWT in HttpOnly Secure Cookies
